# Terminal Command Runner MCP Server

A powerful Model Control Protocol (MCP) server that provides terminal command execution and file system management capabilities for AI assistants through a RESTful API interface.

## üåü Features

### Terminal Management
- Execute commands with configurable timeouts
- Manage long-running processes in the background
- Fetch output from active command sessions
- List all active sessions and system processes
- Terminate or kill processes
- Command blacklisting for security

### File System Operations
- Read and write files
- Create directories
- List directory contents
- Move/rename files
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Get detailed file information

### Advanced Features
- Precise text editing with search and replace
- System information retrieval
- Mathematical expression evaluation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neoforge-dev/neoforge-mcp-server.git
cd python-server-mcp
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .
```

3. Start the MCP server:
```bash
python server.py
```

The server will start on http://0.0.0.0:8000.

## üîß Configuration

Configure Cursor to use this MCP service by adding it to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "NeoMCP": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/path/to/python-server-mcp/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
