# Terminal Command Runner MCP - Product Context

## Purpose

The Terminal Command Runner MCP serves as a bridge between client applications and the system's command-line interface. It enables remote execution of terminal commands through a standardized API, allowing for secure and controlled access to system resources.

## Problem Statement

- Direct shell access requires full system permissions and poses security risks
- Traditional shell interfaces lack timeout control and background processing capabilities
- Remote command execution typically requires complex setup (SSH, etc.)
- Standard APIs don't provide unified access to system operations and file management

## Target Users

- Developers building tools that need system access
- Applications requiring command-line utilities
- Automation systems that need to execute and monitor system tasks
- Development environments needing secure command execution

## User Experience Goals

- Simple API interface for executing commands
- Reliable process management for long-running tasks
- Secure file operations with appropriate guardrails
- Consistent error handling and reporting
- Ability to stream command output in real-time

## Expected Workflow

1. Client connects to the MCP server via SSE (Server-Sent Events)
2. Client invokes tools to execute commands or perform file operations
3. Server executes the requested operations with appropriate security checks
4. Results are returned to the client with standardized output format
5. Long-running processes can be monitored and managed independently

## Integration Context

The MCP server is designed to be used as part of a larger system, often integrated with:
- Development tools and IDEs
- DevOps and CI/CD pipelines
- System administration utilities
- Automation frameworks
