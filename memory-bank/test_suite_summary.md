# Terminal Command Runner MCP - Test Suite Summary

## Implemented Components

1. **Test Directory Structure**:
   - `tests/` directory for all test files
   - `tests/data/` for test data files
   - `tests/conftest.py` for common fixtures

2. **Test Files**:
   - `test_command_execution.py`: Tests for command execution and process management
   - `test_file_operations.py`: Tests for file system operations
   - `test_system_utilities.py`: Tests for system utilities and miscellaneous features

3. **Test Utilities**:
   - `run_tests.py`: Script to run all tests with configurable options
   - `missing_functions.py`: Script to identify missing functions
   - `test_manually.py`: Manual test script for file operations
   - `test_system_manually.py`: Manual test script for system utilities

4. **Test Fixtures**:
   - `temp_dir`: Creates a temporary directory for file tests
   - `sample_text_file`: Creates a sample text file for testing
   - `long_running_process`: Sets up a long-running process for testing
   - Various mock fixtures for testing without side effects

5. **Memory Bank Documentation**:
   - Created core Memory Bank files with project documentation
   - Documented missing functions in `memory-bank/missing_functions.md`
   - Updated README.md with testing information

## Test Results

### Manual Tests

All manual tests for file operations and system utilities are now passing:

1. **File Operations Tests**:
   - Reading files ✅
   - Writing files ✅
   - Creating directories ✅
   - Listing directory contents ✅
   - Moving files ✅
   - Searching files ✅
   - Getting file information ✅

2. **System Utilities Tests**:
   - System information retrieval ✅
   - Mathematical expression evaluation ✅
   - Edit block functionality ✅
   - Process listing ✅
   - Command execution and control ✅
   - Command blacklisting ✅

### Automated Test Status

The pytest-based automated tests are not currently running due to environment issues. The following problems need to be addressed:

1. **Virtual Environment Configuration**: The virtual environment needs to be properly set up with pytest.
2. **Server Startup Issues**: The server starts automatically when imported, causing port conflicts.
3. **Test Isolation**: Need to ensure tests can run independently without interfering with each other.

## Test Categories

1. **Command Execution Tests**:
   - Basic command execution with different exit codes
   - Command output capture and validation
   - Timeout handling for long-running commands
   - Background process management
   - Process termination
   - Command blacklisting for security

2. **File Operation Tests**:
   - Reading files with size limits
   - Writing content to files
   - Creating directories
   - Listing directory contents
   - Moving/renaming files
   - Searching for files with patterns
   - Getting file metadata

3. **System Utility Tests**:
   - System information retrieval
   - Mathematical expression evaluation
   - Process listing and management
   - Session tracking
   - Output streaming verification

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Test Environment**:
   - Fix the virtual environment setup for pytest
   - Modify server.py to avoid auto-starting during tests
   - Implement proper test isolation with fixtures

2. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Add more edge case tests
   - Test error conditions more thoroughly
   - Add performance tests

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add GitHub Actions or other CI system for automated testing
   - Configure code coverage reporting

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add docstrings to all test functions
   - Create a detailed testing guide
