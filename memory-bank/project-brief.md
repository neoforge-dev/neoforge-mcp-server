# Terminal Command Runner MCP - Project Brief

## Overview

This project implements a Terminal Command Runner using the Message Control Protocol (MCP) server. It provides a set of tools to execute shell commands, manage files, perform system operations, and power AI Coding Agents through a standardized API interface.

## Core Requirements

1. **Command Execution**: Safely execute terminal commands with timeout control and background processing
2. **File Management**: Read, write, move, and search files with appropriate security measures
3. **Process Management**: List, monitor, and terminate running processes
4. **System Information**: Provide system details and utilities for diagnostic purposes
5. **AI Coding Agent Tools**: Enable advanced capabilities for AI-powered code assistance and development

## Goals

- Create a secure interface for executing shell commands remotely
- Provide robust error handling and security measures
- Enable long-running background processes with output streaming
- Support standard file system operations with appropriate safeguards
- Implement safety features to prevent dangerous commands execution
- Empower AI Coding Agents with deep code understanding capabilities
- Enable intelligent code refactoring with behavior preservation
- Facilitate automated test generation for comprehensive test coverage
- Support dependency impact analysis for safer code modifications
- Automate code review to maintain quality and standards

## Scope

The MCP server implements a REST API with the following capabilities:
- Command execution with configurable timeouts
- Process monitoring and management
- File system operations (read, write, search, etc.)
- System information retrieval
- Safety features (command blacklisting)
- AI Coding Agent capabilities:
  - Code understanding and relationship mapping
  - Intelligent refactoring with behavior validation
  - Automated test generation with edge case detection
  - Dependency impact analysis with visualization
  - Code review automation with best practice verification

## Non-Goals

- GUI interface (command-line and API only)
- Complex permission systems (basic safety checks only)
- Platform-specific features (focus on cross-platform compatibility)
- Complete IDE replacement (focused on specific agent capabilities)
