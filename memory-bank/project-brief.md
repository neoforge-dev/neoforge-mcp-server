# Terminal Command Runner MCP - Project Brief

## Overview

This project implements a Terminal Command Runner using the Message Control Protocol (MCP) server. It provides a set of tools to execute shell commands, manage files, and perform system operations through a standardized API interface.

## Core Requirements

1. **Command Execution**: Safely execute terminal commands with timeout control and background processing
2. **File Management**: Read, write, move, and search files with appropriate security measures
3. **Process Management**: List, monitor, and terminate running processes
4. **System Information**: Provide system details and utilities for diagnostic purposes

## Goals

- Create a secure interface for executing shell commands remotely
- Provide robust error handling and security measures
- Enable long-running background processes with output streaming
- Support standard file system operations with appropriate safeguards
- Implement safety features to prevent dangerous commands execution

## Scope

The MCP server implements a REST API with the following capabilities:
- Command execution with configurable timeouts
- Process monitoring and management
- File system operations (read, write, search, etc.)
- System information retrieval
- Safety features (command blacklisting)

## Non-Goals

- GUI interface (command-line and API only)
- Complex permission systems (basic safety checks only)
- Platform-specific features (focus on cross-platform compatibility)
