## Recent Changes
- **Fixed Language Adapter Tests:** Resolved failures in `test_language_adapters.py` by correcting JS root node type conversion and adding `ValueError` for empty input to both JS and Swift parsers.
- **Fixed Mock Parser Fallback:** Corrected `CodeParser.parse` to properly use the `MockParser` instance from `mock_parser.py` during fallback.
- **Fixed Import Parsing:** 
  - Updated `MockParser` to correctly handle relative import levels (`.` and `..`).
  - Updated `CodeAnalyzer` to look for `import_statement` and `import_from_statement` node types.
- **Fixed Class Method Extraction:** Updated `CodeAnalyzer._extract_class` to correctly find the `body` node and extract `function_definition` children (methods) within it.
- **Corrected Test Assertions:** Adjusted assertions in `test_analyze_code` and `test_analyze_file` to reflect the design where class methods are stored within the class structure, not in the top-level functions list.
- **Added Debugging:** Enhanced logging and added print statements to trace execution flow during parser fallback.
