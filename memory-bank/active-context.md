## Focus
- Tech debt reduction
- Docs update
- Tools enhancement
- Testing/Monitoring

## Recent âœ…
- All servers implemented
- Shared utils created
- Base server class
- Initial docs
- Issues identified

## Priority Tasks

   - Error handling
   - Logging/monitoring
   - Security

2. Docs
   - README
   - API docs
   - Deployment guides

3. Tools
   - Tool chains
   - Code analysis
   - LLM integration

4. Testing
   - Integration
   - E2E monitoring
   - Security
   - Benchmarks

## Status
Core: 100% | Servers: 100%
Tech Debt: 60% | Docs: 60%
Testing: 20% | Security: 70%
Monitoring: 80%

## Issues
1. Server
   - BaseServer migration
   - Error handling
   - Logging gaps
   - Monitoring gaps

2. Testing
   - Integration missing
   - Security tests
   - No benchmarks
   - Low coverage

## Core Deps
- External: FastAPI, OpenTelemetry, PyYAML, ruff, pytest
- Internal: Utils, BaseServer, Testing framework

## Notes
- Focus on migrating servers to use shared utilities
- Documentation must be kept in sync with changes
- Consider creating server migration guide
- Monitor performance impact of new utilities
- Plan for gradual server migration
