      - Currently creating both module and symbol nodes for each import
      - Need to modify `_process_imports` to only create appropriate nodes
    - Directory test edge creation needs fixing:
      - Test expects 1 import edge but getting 2 for `from module1 import func1`
      - Currently creating edges to both module and symbol import nodes
      - Need to modify `_process_imports` to create only one edge per import
