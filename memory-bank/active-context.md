# Terminal Command Runner MCP - Active Context

## Current Focus
- AI Coding Agent MCP tools implementation
- Code Understanding Tool development
  - Core components (Parser, Analyzer, SymbolExtractor) implemented
  - Tree-sitter integration complete with fallback to mock parser
  - Unit and integration tests in progress
  - Working on relationship graph building and semantic mapping implementation
  - **Current Test Issues**:
    - Import node creation needs refinement:
      - Test expects 4 import nodes but getting 6 (os, sys.path, typing.List, typing.Optional)
      - Currently creating both module and symbol nodes for each import
      - Need to modify `_process_imports` to only create appropriate nodes
    - Directory test edge creation needs fixing:
      - Test expects 1 import edge but getting 2 for `from module1 import func1`
      - Currently creating edges to both module and symbol import nodes
      - Need to modify `_process_imports` to create only one edge per import
    - Coverage improvements needed:
      - Current coverage at 23% (target: 90%)
      - Key files needing coverage:
        - server/code_understanding/analyzer.py (27%)
        - server/code_understanding/extractor.py (15%)
        - server/code_understanding/symbols.py (0%)
        - server/core.py (0%)
        - server/llm.py (0%)
