# Progress Tracker

## What Works
- **`BaseServer`**: Core `BaseServer` class implemented with basic configuration, logging, error handling, and health check.
- **`NeoDevServer` Migration**: Successfully migrated to `BaseServer`. Basic tests passing.
- **`NeoOpsServer` Migration**: Successfully migrated to `BaseServer`. Basic tests and placeholder endpoint tests (`/processes`, `/resources`) passing.
- **`NeoLocalServer` Migration**: Successfully migrated to `BaseServer`. Basic health check and placeholder endpoint tests passing.
- **`NeoLLMServer` Migration**: Successfully migrated/verified using `BaseServer`. Basic health check and placeholder endpoint tests passing.

## What's Left to Build / Next Steps
1.  ~~Migrate `NeoLocalServer`~~ (Done)
2.  ~~Add `NeoLocalServer` Tests~~ (Done - Basic & Placeholders)
3.  ~~Migrate `NeoLLMServer`~~ (Done/Verified)
4.  ~~Add `NeoLLMServer` Tests~~ (Done - Basic & Placeholders)
5.  **Migrate `NeoDOServer`**: Refactor `NeoDOServer` to use `BaseServer`. (Current Focus)
6.  **Add `NeoDOServer` Tests**: Add basic health check and placeholder endpoint tests.
7.  **Increase Test Coverage**: Bring total coverage above 90%.
8.  **Implement Real Endpoint Logic**: Replace placeholder logic in server endpoints and tests.
9.  **Integration Tests**: Add tests for inter-server communication.
10. **Security Implementation**: Integrate JWT, rate limiting, RBAC.
11. **Address Warnings**: Resolve `PytestDeprecationWarning` and `Coverage Warning`.

## Current Status
- **Overall**: Actively migrating individual servers to the `BaseServer` pattern. Basic tests are being added post-migration.
- **Coverage**: ~9% (Still below required threshold).
- **Blockers**: None currently blocking migration. Low coverage is a known issue being deferred.

## Known Issues / Risks
- **Low Test Coverage**: Significant risk. Requires dedicated effort post-migration. (High Priority)
- **Swift Parser Parsing Issue**: `Coverage Warning` indicates potential issues with `test_swift_parser.py`. (Medium Priority)
- **Asyncio Fixture Scope**: `PytestDeprecationWarning` needs configuration update. (Low Priority)
- **Placeholder Logic**: Tests relying on placeholders are not robust. (High Priority - post-migration)
