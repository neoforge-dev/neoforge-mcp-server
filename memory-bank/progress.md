# Progress Tracker

*Current priorities, status, next steps, and known issues are tracked in `active-context.md`.*

## Major Completed Milestones
- BaseServer Implementation: All servers migrated.
- Initial Error Handling: Standardized via `MCPError` and `ErrorHandlerMiddleware`.
- Security Foundation: `ApiKey` dataclass and basic `SecurityManager` structure implemented.
- LLM Server Tests: All 14 tests for LLM server passing with 92% code coverage.
- System Utilities Tests: Fixed list_sessions test by properly using CommandExecutor.
- JS Parser Tests: Fixed by correctly checking the 're-export' type instead of using incorrect property.

## Key Blockers / Areas for Improvement
- Low Test Coverage: Significant effort required to reach >90% target (current ~14.7%).
- JS Parser Limitations: Potential future risk (monitor impact).
