# Missing Functions for Test Suite

Based on analysis of the test suite, the following functions need to be implemented in `server.py` to make the tests work:

## Global Variables
- `active_sessions`: Dictionary to track running command sessions
- `session_lock`: Threading lock for thread-safe access to active_sessions
- `blacklisted_commands`: Set of commands that are blocked for security reasons

## Functions

### Process Management
- `list_sessions()`: List all active command sessions
- `list_processes()`: List all system processes
- `kill_process()`: Kill a process by PID with configurable signal

### File Operations
- `read_file()`: Read file contents with size limits
- `write_file()`: Write content to a file
- `create_directory()`: Create a new directory
- `list_directory()`: List directory contents
- `move_file()`: Move or rename files
- `search_files()`: Find files matching a pattern
- `get_file_info()`: Get metadata about a file

### Command Control
- `block_command()`: Add a command to the blacklist
- `unblock_command()`: Remove a command from the blacklist

### Utilities
- `system_info()`: Get system information
- `calculate()`: Evaluate a mathematical expression
- `edit_block()`: Apply edits to a file with a diff-like syntax

## Implementation Guidelines

Each function should:
- Be decorated with `@mcp.tool()`
- Include proper docstrings with parameter descriptions
- Return results in a dictionary format
- Include appropriate error handling
- Implement security checks where needed

Example template for a new function:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def function_name(param1: type, param2: type = default) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Description of what the function does.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with operation results
    """
    try:
        # Implementation
        result = {"success": True, "key": value}
    except Exception as e:
        result = {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
    
    return result
```
