# Code Understanding Module Fixes

## Fixed Issues
- Fixed _extract_functions method in CodeAnalyzer to correctly process function nodes
- Fixed _process_node in CodeAnalyzer to handle nested nodes properly
- Fixed analyze_file to properly handle file not found errors
- Fixed parameter extraction in _process_function of SymbolExtractor
- Fixed _process_identifier to properly track references
- Fixed _process_assignment to correctly store variable symbols
- Fixed _process_import to handle both string and bytes input
- Updated test_integration.py to use correct SymbolExtractor implementation

## Improvements
- Improved test coverage for code understanding module from ~9% to 16.9%
- Particularly improved extractor.py coverage from ~28% to 75%
- All tests in test_analyzer.py, test_extractor.py, and test_integration.py now pass

## Remaining Issues
- Some JavaScript parsing issues remain, but were out of scope for this fix
- OpenTelemetry logging error is unrelated to code changes
